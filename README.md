# SurveyMod

Cave surveying tools, for  actual cavers.

Have you ever used a minimap mod with a cave overlay and thought: "this is too easy and doesn't involve enough external software"? Well, good news! This mod adds some tools that will help you quickly produce .svx files for use in cave survey software of your choice.

Craft a survey stick with the following recipe:
```
  R
 S 
S
```
Where R is a redstone torch, and S is a stick.

Before starting a survey, set the filename with ```/survey name```, and the cave name with ```/survey cave```. Then you can start the survey with ```/survey begin```. 
Start a leg by right clicking with the survey stick, then right click all survey stations on the leg. Shift right click to end the leg. Once you finish a leg, type ```/survey save``` to save the leg, or ```/survey clear``` to delete it. 
Once you finish, type ```/survey end``` to end the survey file. The file is written to the "MinecraftSurveyTool" directory in your home directory. This cannot be changed, yet.


This is an alpha release, and it's super rough around the edges. See this link for a video demo:
